    "EPI is an algorithm to infere a parameter distribution $Q$ satisfying\n",
    "$Y = s(Q)$ given a (discrete) data probability distribution $y_i \\sim Y$\n",
    "and a model implementing the mapping $s: Q \\to Y$. The (forward) model\n",
    "describes the mapping from the parameter points $q_i$ to the data points\n",
    "$y_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following we will look at temperature data over the globe and a\n",
    "model for the dependence of the temperature $y_i$ on the latitude $q_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to derive the parameter distribution $\\Phi_Q$ from the data\n",
    "distribution $\\Phi_Y$. This is the inverse of what our (forward) model\n",
    "is providing. To solve the inverse problem, EPI uses the multi-dimension\n",
    "transformation formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the real world, problems with a known continous data distribution are\n",
    "very sparse. Instead, we often rely on discrete measurements. EPI start\n",
    "with discrete data points as input and derives a continous distribution\n",
    "using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) techniques. From this data\n",
    "distribution the EPI algorithm derives the parameter distribution. To\n",
    "close the cycle between the data and parameters, we can again sample\n",
    "from this distribution and use the forward model to get a discrete\n",
    "distribution of the parameters.\n",
