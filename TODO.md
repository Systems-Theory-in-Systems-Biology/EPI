# TODOs

This implementation should in the end be usable with the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) format.
The goal is to enable reuse, facilitated cooperation and boost visability.

For the implementation it is important to follow the PEP8 guidelines and write a proper documentation for everything.

- [ ] Test Jax for gpu: ```pip install --upgrade "jax[cuda]" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html```

- [ ] create module for straight forward EPI usage
- [ ] create and implement example usecases
- [ ] make the toolbox usable for SBML models

- [ ] Check with supervisors:
