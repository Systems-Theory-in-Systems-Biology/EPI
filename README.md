# Implementation of the Euler Parameter Inference (EPI) algorithm

The EPI returns a parameter distribution, which is consistent with
the observed data by solving the inverse problem directly. In
the case of a one-to-one mapping, this is the true underlying
distribution.

This implementation should in the end be usable with the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) format.
The goal is to enable reuse, facilitated cooperation and boost visability. 

For the implementation it is important to follow the PEP8 guidelines and write a proper documentation for everything.

## TODO:
- [ ] create module for straight forward EPI usage
- [ ] create and implement example usecases
- [ ] make the toolbox usable for SBML models
