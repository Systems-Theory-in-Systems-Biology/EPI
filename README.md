Eulerian Parameter Inference (EPI) is a powerful and novel method for inverse model parameter inference. The eulerpi package provides an implementation of the EPI algorithm, which takes observed data and a model as input and returns a parameter distribution consistent with the observed data by solving the inverse problem directly. In case the model describes a one-to-one mapping between parameters and simulation results, the inferred parameter distribution is the true underlying distribution.

## Documentation

The full documentation of this software, including a detailed tutorial on how to use EPI and the api documentation, can be found under [Documentation](https://Systems-Theory-in-Systems-Biology.github.io/EPI/).

## Features

EPI supports

- SBML ode models
- User provided models
- Models with automatic differentiation using jax

## Installation

The package is available on pypi and can be installed with:

```bash
pip install eulerpi
```

or

```bash
pip install eulerpi[sbml]
```

for the support of sbml models.

Make sure that you have the following C++ libraries installed

```bash
sudo apt install -y swig libblas-dev libatlas-base-dev libhdf5-dev
```

You can also build the library from the latest source code by following the [Development Quickstart Guide](./DEVELOPMENT.md#quickstart).

## Using the library

To use EPI, derive your model from the `Model` class and implement the abstract functions. Here's an example code snippet:

```python
# my_model.py

import jax.numpy as jnp

from eulerpi.core.model import Model

class MyModel(Model):

    param_dim = N # The dimension of a parameter point
    data_dim = M # The dimension of a data point

    def forward(self, param):
        return jnp.array(...)

    def jacobian(self, param):
        return jnp.array(...)
```

To evaluate the model and infer the parameter distribution, call:

```python
from eulerpi.sampling import inference

from my_model import MyModel

# This line is needed for multiprocessing in python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    central_param = np.array([0.5, -1.5, ...])
    param_limits = np.array([[0.0, 1.0], [-3.0, 0.0], ...])

    model = MyModel(central_param, param_limits)
    inference(model=model, data="my_data.csv")
```

The `data` argument can be a numpy-2d-array or a PathLike object that points to a CSV file. In the example shown above, the CSV file `my_data.csv` should contain the data in the following format:

```text
datapoint_dim1, datapoint_dim2, datapoint_dim3, ..., datapoint_dimN
datapoint_dim1, datapoint_dim2, datapoint_dim3, ..., datapoint_dimN
datapoint_dim1, datapoint_dim2, datapoint_dim3, ..., datapoint_dimN
...
datapoint_dim1, datapoint_dim2, datapoint_dim3, ..., datapoint_dimN
```

This corresponds to a matrix with the shape `nSamples x data_dim`. For more available options and parameters for the `inference` method, please refer to the [api documentation](https://systems-theory-in-systems-biology.github.io/EPI/eulerpi.core.html#module-eulerpi.core.inference). Note that the inference can be done with grid-based methods (dense grids, sparse grids) or sampling methods (mcmc).

The results are stored in the following location:

* `./Applications/<ModelName>/.../OverallParams.csv`
* `./Applications/<ModelName>/.../OverallSimResults.csv`
* `./Applications/<ModelName>/.../OverallDensityEvals.csv`

These files contain the sampled parameters, the corresponding data points obtained from the model forward pass, and the corresponding density evaluation.
